# Hollow Knight - Category Extensions - All Charm Notches (1.2.2.1)

This Path of Pain% route is based on the document found at https://pastebin.com/raw/GFveQwUd.

## Credits

* jeffisepic, with liberal borrowing from the CP route by Quacksilver, Mathulu, and Paum
* TopHatLuke (for conversion to markdown in this document, and minor rewording)

## Route Objective

The objective for this category is to obtain all 8 extra notches (11 total).

## Notation

  Numbers in brackets ("[" and "]") denote target *geo* amounts. E.g. [200]

  Numbers in parentheses ("(" and ")") denote target number of charms. E.g. (12)

  Numbers in braces ("{" and "}") denote target *essence* amounts. E.g. {1600}

  Note: running geo is static sources, you'll pick up random geo throughout the run, and there are a few places where needed numbers are listed, if you don't have that amount by then then kill stuff, but you should have enough basically every time.
