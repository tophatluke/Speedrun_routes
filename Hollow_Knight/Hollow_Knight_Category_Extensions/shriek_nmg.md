Route is identical to Any% up until getting Mantis Claw.

After getting Mantis Claw, go back up and make your way to Queen’s Station, through Fog Canyon, and to the Overgrown Mound.

Fight through the Squit Gauntlet to receive Howling Wraiths before save-warping back to Ancestral Mound.

From there, buy Shaman Stone, Shade pogo up to Blue Lake, take the elevator down to King’s Station, and go to Kingdom’s Edge.

Make your way to Hornet 2; you will need to pogo off a Primal Aspid to reach her.

After acquiring King’s Brand, backtrack to City of Tears and fall down the broken elevator shaft to Ancient Basin.

From there, make your way to the Abyss and acquire Abyss Shriek to complete the run.
